# Nested_PPE_detection
<br /> This project is the implementation of conference paper entitled "Nested Network for Detecting PPE on Large Construction Sites Based on Frame Segmentation".\
## The main goals of the project are:

<br />(1) Detect workers in near, mid, and far-field views.
<br />(2) Detect hardhat, no-hardhat, safety vest, and no safety vest.
<br />(3) Matching detected workers in two camera views.
<br />(4) Generating PPE detection safety reports.

<br /> In order to run the Nested network for worker and PPE detection:
```
Main.py
```
The image below shows PPE detection results in near, mid, and far-field views.
