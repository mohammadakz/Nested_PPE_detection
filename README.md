# Nested_PPE_detection
This project is the implementation of conference paper entitled "Nested Network for Detecting PPE on Large Construction Sites Based on Frame Segmentation".
The main goals of the project are:
```
Main.py
```
wehere, (100, 200) are the pixel coordinates of the equioment
```
equipment_world_coordinate = eq.transfer_2d_to_3d(100, 200)
```
The image bellow shows perspective locating of equipments on the construction site.
